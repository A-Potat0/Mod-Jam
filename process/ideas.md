5. tongue is snake (the tougn moves as the snake from snake would. the flys are the apples)
6. flys cause dimentional shifs (every time you catch a fly the theme of the game changes to another random theme)
7. flys have different powers (super speed, super strenght, invisibility, telekenesis, and other powers. each power affects the game differently and has a different color)
8. frog can jump (instead of shooting their tongue the frog jumps to get to the fly, but...? )
