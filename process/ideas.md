# Mod Jam ideas

1. Frog is doing a platformer (you move the frog arround to try to get the flys)

2. tongue is doing a platformer (when you shoot the tongue platform (leaves?) apear that the tongue needs to platform on to get to the flys)

3. fly is doing a platformer (you control the fly(s?) and try to escape the frog through platforming)

4. fly is flappybird (you control the fly and the frog's tongue are the pipes)

5. // tongue is snake (the tougn moves as the snake from snake would. the flys are the apples)

6. // flys cause dimentional shifs (every time you catch a fly the theme of the game changes to another random theme)

7. // flys have different powers (super speed, super strenght, invisibility, telekenesis, and other powers. each power affects the game differently and has a different color)

8. frog can jump (instead of shooting their tongue the frog jumps to get to the fly, but...? )

9. vegetarian frog (the frog only eats the grapes that grow at the top of the screen. if you eat a fly the frog is verry unhappy and you loose)

10. flys are part of a gang (the more flys you eat the more danger you are in and the more apear. instead of side to side, the flys come twards you. be carful)

11. crossy tongue (you try to avoid the flys to get to the other side. when you reach the top of the canvas it increases)

12. the frog is a trafic officer (the frog uses their tongue to stop the flys from coliding with other flys that crosss the intersection)

13. the flys have a restraning order against the frog (if the frog eats a fly, the police are called. (in real life?))

14. spy fly (one of the flys is on your side gathering intel for the frog team. be carfull not to do freindly fire)

15. drunk frog (the tongue goes haywire. you have dificulty controlong the tongue)

16. you date every fly (when you touch a fly the game becomes a dating simulator and you have to convince the fly to date you (get eatem by you))

17. hyperrealism (the game is extremely realistic)

18. funny hyperrealism (atempt to use multiple stock photos to represent the game (you can stil see the white stock photo outline))

19. the frog is a prince (when the frog kiss the princess fly it turns into a prince. princes typicaly do not eat flys so...)

20. frog in a frog in a frog in a frog in a frog in a .... (instead of shooting a tongue you soot a frog that shoots a frog that shoots a frog...)

21.
